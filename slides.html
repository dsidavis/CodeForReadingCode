# Goals

+ What are the sorts of things you want to know when confronted with a code base

+ Some available tools

+ Infrastructure for building new tools

---

# Context

+ Start collaborating on an existing project
+ Reviewing other people's code (for a paper)
+ Take over existing code base
+ Just trying to understand a package
+ Trying to determine which package to extend/build upon
+ Finding good/bad practices

---
# Approaches

+ Read the documentation
+ Read any overview of the software design.
+ Talk with the original authors, if possible.
  + But before, familiarize yourself with the code
+ Read the code - last! (except for good/bad practices)

---

# Starting Points

+ Two common setups
  + One or more scripts, e.g., R file or files + data
  + Collection of functions
      + R package
      + collection of files

+ Different goals and questions
  + Scripts
    + understand what the input files
    + the outputs - plots, files, ...
    + what packages are used
    + is all the code relevant, actually used
    + are some expressions repeated with only a single change, so could be turned into a iteration to avoid repetition
    + are there logically separate blocks doing different tasks
    + can parts be run in parallel
    + when is a variable no longer used (so we can remove it and free memory)
    + ...

  + Package/Functions
    + which functions are intended for direct use and which are support functions
    + what functions call what other functions
    + what are the classes that are defined/used
    + what methods are defined
    + do functions use non-local (global) variables
       + do they update non-local variables
    + is non-standard evaluation (NSE) used
    + how can we refactor the code
      + make smaller functions
    + do releated parameters have the same name
    + if I add a new required argument to foo(), what are the places I have to change the calls to foo().
    + how are errors handled
    + ...
---

# Simple Queries Direct from R
## For Functions, Packages, Classes, Methods

+ source()
   + Read functions into a separate environment
      + `CodeAnalysis::loadCode()`

+ ls()

+ getClasses()
```
getClasses("package:CodeDepends")
```

+ `getClass("Script")`

+ `showMethods()` &amp; `methods()`
```
showMethods(, "package:CodeDepends")
```

---
# Additional Query Functions

+ selectMethod()
  + way to determine which method will be called for a given set of input classes

+ formals(fun)
  + parameters and default expressions for a function

+ body(fun)
  + the code for the body of a function, separate from the parameters

---
# Class Hierarchy

+ Object-oriented programming
  + How do we know the classes and their relationships to each other

+ S4 classes are more structured
  + Provide information after being defined by running code defining the classes, i.e. source() or install.packages()

+ Matrix package uses S4. Find all classes it defines
```
library(Matrix)
mk = getClasses("package:Matrix")
```

+ Look at the dMatrix class' definition
```
z = getClass("dMatrix")
```
+ The class representing a class definition is classRepresentation
```
class(z)
getClass("classRepresentation")
```

+ Is this a VIRTUAL class?
```
z@virtual
```

+ What classes does this class inherit from?

```
names(z@contains)
```

---
# Class Hierarchy Tree

+ How are the classes related to each other
  + Display as a graph

+ Define several classes related to shapes - circles, squares, rectangles, ....
```
source("classEg.R")
```

+ Create a graph visualizing the class hierarchy
```
o = mkClassGraph(, "Shape")
library(igraph)
gg = graph_from_data_frame(o, directed = TRUE)
plot(gg)
```
---

<img src="ShapeClassGraph.png"/>

---

# Call Graph

+ Analogous to a class graph, we have a function call graph

+ What other functions does a given function call
  + Nodes are functions
  + Edge between A and B - A calls B
    + directed


```
library(CodeDepends)
g = makeCallGraph("package:CodeDepends")
plot(g)
plot(g, "neato")
plot(g, "circo")
```

---
<img src="CallGraph.png"/>
---

# Unexported Functions - getNamespace()

+ For a package, ls() only lists the exported functions
+ getNamespace() gives us the entire set of variables/symbols in the package
  + includes the unexported symbols


```
e = getNamespace("CodeDepends")
ll = as.list(e)
ll = ll[ sapply(ll, is.function) ]
```

+ Now have the internal functions as well as the exported ones

```
g = makeCallGraph(ll, packages = "CodeDepends(all)")
plot(g, "neato")
```

---

# Static Analysis

+ Static versus Run-time analysis
  + Understand w/o having to run the code or need the inputs
  + Need run-time to find out
     + which parts of code are actually run (branches)
     + how many times a function is called
     + size of data objects
     + how much time a function takes (profiling)

+ Static analysis on
  1. evaluated/installed code
  1. source code files

+ Difference
  + In 1, functions, classes and methods are already defined and regular objects
  + In 2, use the parse tree/abstract syntax tree (AST)

+ Both appropriate for different operations


---
# Meta-programming
## R Code as Data


+ Can use
  + a text editor and search for strings
  + regular expressions

+ More structuredd approach

+ Parse the code into an AST - Abstract Syntax Tree
  + structured elements such as function **expression**, **call**, **if**, **for**, **<-**, **=**
  + the bold-faced text implies class names in R for language objects

+ Traverse the tree, collecting information of interest.

+ rstatic package provides alternative analogous representation and functionality

---
## Unused Parameters/Formal Arguments 

+ Identify parameters that are not used in a function
  + Would remove them to simplify the function
  + or check that there were no typos and we are referring to them by a different name

+ findUnusedArgs in CodeAnalysis package

+ Example of function with an unused parameter (u)
```
f =
function(a, b, u)
{
      z = a + b
      ans = g(z)
}
```

+ Code to identify this unused parameter
```
CodeAnalysis::findUnusedArgs(f, FALSE)
```

+ Can also correct the code and return the modified function with the parameter(s) removed.

---
## Typos

+ We have a parameter named `xyz` but refer to it as `xyx`

+ Result
  + unused parameter
  + global variable

+ Can check global is close to name of unused parameter.

+ Example function
```
f = function(abc, xyz)
        abc + xyx
```

+ Match the typo for the global variable to the "close" parameter name:
```
m = CodeAnalysis::findUnusedArgs(f, FALSE)
g = CodeAnalysis::getGlobals(f)$variables
agrep(g, names(formals(f)), value = TRUE)
```

+ Can check globals are close to parameter,
  + or also correspond to an unused parameter.

---

# Find S3 Classes
###  Assignments via `class(x) = names`

+ Unlike S4, S3 classes are semi/un-structured
   + assign the class attribute via
```
  class(x) = characerVector
```

+ Detect class assignment

```
f =
function(file)
{
    d = read.csv(file)
    class(d) = c("SpatialTimeSeries", class(d))
    d
}
```

```
S3Assignments(f)
```

---

# Identify Input Files
### Read by functions we know read from connections

+ Want to find literal strings identifying the names of
  files we read (data) from

+ Look for calls to read.table(), read.csv(), readLines(), etc...

+ Example in [readFiles.R](readFiles.R)

+ Parse the code - not source() which would run it.

```
e = parse("readFiles.R")
```

+ Call getFilesRead() on the collection of expressions
```
CodeAnalysis::getFilesRead(e)
```

---

# Non-standard evaluation

+ Find where code uses forms of non-standard evaluation - NSE
  + NSE includes calls to eval(), evalq(), get(), assign(), rm()
  + other forms all over tidyverse, magrittr - but don't handle those as not built into language.

+ Analyze the write.csv function for NSE
```
library(CodeAnalysis)
findNSE(write.csv)
```

+ Returns the nodes in the AST - abstract syntax tree - corresponding to these
  expressions that are the NSE.

+ Uses Nick Ulle's rstatic package
  + Represents the language objects differently than built into R
  + But conceptually same, just more structured and reference based
    + Can walk up the tree via parents which we can't do with R language objects.

+ More on R static later

---
# CodeDepends
<!-- What expressions in the script might not be needed-->

+ CodeDepends package

+ Reads expressions in a script, or body of a function
  + Extracts information from each about
    + input variables
    + output variables
    + packages used
    + literal strings (potentially file names)

+ Can determine which variables
   + which are not used again
   + when can be removed
   + logical blocks of related expressions

+ Summarize the flow of code
   + via visualization

---
# CodeDepends

+ Read script and get information for each top-level expression
```
sc = readScript("changepoint.R")
info = getInputs(sc)
```

+ Find the packages that are/may be used
```
unlist(sapply(info, slot, "libraries"))
```

+ Computational Flow 
```
g = makeVariableGraph(frags = sc, info = info)
plot(g)
```

+ Plot the timeline of variables
```
dtm = getDetailedTimelines(sc, info)
```

---
# Language objects in R

+ We've done all of this without discussing how we compute the information

+ We work with R language objects
  + expression, call, if,

+ Get language objects via
   + parse(), quote(), substitute()
   + body()  for body of a function
   + formals() for formal arguments or parameters

+ Each of these is a essentially a list
  + elements of the list correspond to do the different parts of the language object
  + e.g. in a call, first element is the function being called, second is the first argument, third is the second argument,...
  + In an if object, first element is symbol if, second is the condition being tested, third is body for the TRUE part, optional 4th element is for the body of the `else`

+ Nick's rstatic package
  + makes these elements clearer and more structure
  + adds the ability to find the parent language element so walk up the tree, not just down.
  + functionality to iterate over the AST elements
  + and many more higher-level tasks

---
# C/C++ Code

+ Can do the same sorts of analyses on 

+ 2 Approaches
   1. Parse Tree - AST on source code
   2. Partially optimized code via LLVM

+ 1. we are working on the raw source code
+ 2. some simplifications of the code have already been made

+ Some tasks easier in 1. or 2.

---
# AST Approach

+ In R, use RCIndex package

+ Reasonably comprehensive document describing the package

+ `tu = parseTU("filename.cc")`

+ `k = getClasses(tu)`
+ `r = getRoutines(tu)`
+ `e = getEnums(tu)`
+ `d = getDataStructures(tu)`

---
# Bodies of Routines

# LLVM
